# This file defines all of the possible elements of the computation
# graph for the onboard behavior stack.
#
# `components` lists the components in order, and defines their permissable inputs and outputs.
# See AllState for attributes that can be listed as inputs or outputs.
#
# The actual implementation of each component must use a subset of the specified inputs
# and must generate a superset of the specified outputs.
