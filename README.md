🚗 [About the GEM e2 vehicle](https://publish.illinois.edu/robotics-autonomy-resources/gem/)

🗎 [ROS code for launching vehicle](https://github.com/hangcui1201/POLARIS_GEM_e2_Real/tree/main)

## Dependencies

GEMstack uses Python 3.7+ and ROS Noetic.  (It is possible to do some offline and simulation work without ROS, but it is highly recommended to install it if you are working on any onboard behavior or training for rosbag files.)  

You should also have the following Python dependencies installed, which you can install from this folder using `pip install -r requirements.txt`:
- GEMstack Dependencies
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - matplotlib
  - opencv-python
  - torch
  - klampt==0.9.2
  - shapely
  - dacite
  - pyyaml
- Perception Dependencies
  - ultralytics

In order to interface with the actual GEM e2 vehicle, you will need [PACMOD2](https://github.com/astuff/pacmod2) - Autonomoustuff's low level interface to vehicle. You will also need Autonomoustuff's [sensor message packages](https://github.com/astuff/astuff_sensor_msgs).  The onboard computer uses Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8, CUDA 11.6, and NVIDIA driver 515, so to minimize compatibility issues you should ensure that these are installed on your development system.

## Running the stack on Ubuntu 20.04 without Docker
### Checking CUDA Version

Before proceeding, check your Nvidia Driver and supported CUDA version:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
This will show your NVIDIA driver version and the maximum supported CUDA version. Make sure you have CUDA 11.8 or 12+ installed.

From Ubuntu 20.04 install [CUDA 11.6](https://gist.github.com/ksopyla/bf74e8ce2683460d8de6e0dc389fc7f5) or [CUDA 12+](https://gist.github.com/ksopyla/ee744bf013c83e4aa3fc525634d893c9) based on your current Nvidia Driver versio.

To check the currently installed CUDA version:
```bash
nvcc --version
```
you can install the dependencies or GEMstack by running `setup/setup_this_machine.sh` from the top-level GEMstack folder.

## Running the stack on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 with Docker
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to check the Nvidia Driver and supported CUDA version before proceeding by following the steps in the previous section.

## Prerequisites
- Docker (In Linux - Make sure to follow the post-installation steps from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/))
- Nvidia Container Toolkit

Try running the sample workload from the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/sample-workload.html) to check if your system is compatible.

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --runtime=nvidia --gpus all ubuntu nvidia-smi
```
You should see the nvidia-smi output similar to [this](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/sample-workload.html#:~:text=all%20ubuntu%20nvidia%2Dsmi-,Your%20output%20should%20resemble%20the%20following%20output%3A,-%2B%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2D%2B%0A%7C%20NVIDIA%2DSMI%20535.86.10).

If you see the output, you are good to go. Otherwise, you will need to install the Docker and NVidia Container Toolkit by following the instructions. 
- For **Docker**, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).
  
- For **Nvidia Container Toolkit**, run `setup/get_nvidia_container.sh` from this directory to install, or see [this](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) for more details.

## Building the Docker image

To build a Docker image with all these prerequisites, you can use the provided Dockerfile by running.

```bash
bash setup/build_docker_image.sh
```

## Running the Docker container

To run the container, you can use the provided Docker Compose file by running.
> [!NOTE]
> If you want to open multiple terminals to run the container, you can use the same command. It will automatically start a new terminal inside the same container.
```bash
bash run_docker_container.sh
```
## Usage Tips and Instructions

### Using Host Volume

You can use the host volume under the container's home directory inside the `<username>` folder. This allows you to build and run files that are on the host machine. For example, if you have a file on the host machine at `/home/<username>/project`, you can access it inside the container at `/home/<username>/host/project`.

### Using Dev Containers Extension in VSCode

To have a good developer environment inside the Docker container, you can use the Dev Containers extension in VSCode. Follow these steps:

1. Install the Dev Containers extension in VSCode.
2. Open the cloned repository in VSCode.
3. Press `ctrl+shift+p`(or select the remote explorer icon from the left bar) and select `Dev-Containers: Attach to Running Container...`.
4. Select the container name `gem_stack-container`.
5. Once attached, Select `File->Open Folder...`.
6. Select the folder/workspace you want to open in the container.

This will set up the development environment inside the Docker container, allowing you to use VSCode features seamlessly.

## Stopping the Docker container

To stop the container, you can use the provided stop script by running.

```bash
bash stop_docker_container.sh
```

## Launching the stack

You will launch a simulation using:

- `python3 main.py --variant=sim launch/LAUNCH_FILE.yaml` where `LAUNCH_FILE.yaml` is your preferred launch file.  Try `python3 main.py --variant=sim launch/fixed_route.yaml`.  Inspect the simulator classes in `GEMstack/onboard/interface/gem_simulator.py` for more information about configuring the simulator.

To launch onboard behavior you will open Terminator / tmux and split it into three terminal windows. In each of them run:

- `cd GEMstack`
- `source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash` to get all of the appropriate ROS environment variables.

Then run:
- (window 1) `roslaunch basic_launch sensor_init.launch`
- (window 2) `roslaunch basic_launch dbw_joystick.launch` (TODO: switch this to `dbw_no_joystick.launch`)
- (window 3) `python3 main.py launch/LAUNCH_FILE.yaml` where `LAUNCH_FILE.yaml` is your preferred launch file. 

Note that if you try to use `import GEMstack` in a script or Jupyter notebook anywhere outside of this directory, Python will not know where the `GEMstack` module is.  If you wish to import `GEMstack` from a script located in a separate directory, you can put

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.getcwd())   #or enter the absolute path of this directory

import GEMstack
```

at the top of your script.  Then, you can run the script from this directory via `python3 PATH/TO/SCRIPT/myscript.py`.  See the scripts in `testing` for an example of how this is done.

You can also install `GEMstack` into the system Python by calling `pip install .`, but this is not recommended because has a couple of drawbacks:
- You might make changes in this directory, e.g., via `git pull`, and then forget to reinstall, so the changes won't be reflected when you run your code.
- If you added model or roadgraph files, e.g., to the `knowledge` directory, they may not be installed.  You will need to edit `pyproject.toml` to include those files.



## Communication and serialization protocols

Sending commands to the vehicle is handled by the ROS-PACMOD interface.  Receiving sensor messages is handled through standard ROS sensor messages.

Generally speaking, the only onboard components that should be reading from sensors are the Perception components.  The only onboard components that should be sending commands to the vehicle are the Execution comopnents.

For internal state messages, which changes rapidly during development, we use raw Python dictionaries, lists, and primitives. This is also known as JSON format.  The `utils.serialization` library makes this easy for you.  We convert strings to and from Python classes that are annotated with the `@dataclass` decorator and you can add your own classes using the `@utils.serialization.register` decorator.  You can then use the `utils.serialization.serialize` and `utils.serialization.deserialize` functions to convert to/from strings or ROS `std_msgs/String` messages. 

Note that all registered class names must be unique.  Also, **versioning** is a major problem if you wish to use legacy logs.  If you gather some logs, change your class' attributes, and then attempt to view those logs again, you may encounter an error or missing data.  The `serialization` module will do as much as it can to fail silently and enter `None` into missing fields, but it can still fail.  If you wish to parse logs that contain legacy data, you can use the `version` keyword to `register`, as follows.

```python
from utils.serialization import register
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
@register(name="MyClass",version="1")
class MyClass_Original:
  x : float
  y : float

@dataclass
@register(name="MyClass",version="2")
class MyClass:
  x : float
  y : float
  time : float

```

Keep in mind that your functions will need to distinguish between the old and new classes.  It may be better in this case just to use a single class and tag `time` as having type `Optional[float]`.  Then, your functions can see whether `time` is `None`, and if so, invoke the old-style behavior.


## Settings

Magic parameters and global variables are a scourge and must be eliminated in production code.  Instead, you will declare parameters in configuration files.  In your code, you will access settings using the `utils.settings` module.  For example, 

```python
from GEMutils.utils import settings
settings.get('key1.key2.attribute')
```

To override a setting temporarily (just for a few run), you can run your script with an optional `--key=value` command-line argument.  For example, to set the simulation scene, you can use `--simulator.scene=PATH/TO/SCENE/FILE`.  

To create new settings or override a setting more permanently, you should dive into `GEMstack/knowledge/defaults/current.yaml`.  This [YAML](https://yaml.org/) formatted configuration file specifies the entire configuration that can be accessed through the `utils.settings` module.  One of these files may `!include` other configuration files, so if you are adding a large number of related settings, e.g., for some component module, it would make sense to create that module's own YAML file.  For example, you may create a YAML file `mymodule_default_config.yaml` add it to `current.yaml` under the `mymodule` key, e.g., `mymodule: !include mymodule_default_config.yaml`.  (Of course, replace `mymodule` with a descriptive name of your module, duh.)

Note that there are settings that configure **an algorithm's behavior** that persist between runs, and there are settings that configure **a particular run**.  If you want to configure an algorithm, put it in `current.yaml`, a descendant configuration file, or elsewhere in `knowledge`.  If you want to configure a single run, you should place those options in the launch file.  The `main.py` entrypoint will consume a run launch file and a settings file, and will place all the run configurations in the `run` attribute of the global settings.  So if you wish to inspect run details or specify per-run behavior, e.g., see whether we are in a simulation run or a hardware run, your algorithm can check `settings.get('run.mode')`.  In general, you should try to minimize how dependent your algorithms are on run settings.

Another way to think about this is that we are trying to **evolve the onboard software stack to generate better behavior** by changing algorithms and their settings. The evolution mechanism is implemented by commits to the repository.  On a day to day level, you will be performing different types of runs, such as simulation tests, unit tests, and full integration tests.  You may be testing a lot of different conditions but the software stack should remain constant for that suite of tests.  If you wish to do an apples-to-apples comparison against a different version of the stack, you should git check out another commit ID, and then perform those same tests.  So if you are configuring the software stack, the setting changes should go into `knowledge`.  If you are configuring how the software stack works just for a single test, the setting changes should go into the launch script or a keyword argument.


## Launch files, pipeline state machine, and the computation graph

Onboard behavior begins by launching an executor, which maintains a *pipeline state machine* that can switch between different top-level behaviors.  Pipelines are usually switched depending on the health state of the system, and are not appropriate for handling driving logic.  For example, the `recovery` pipeline is a mandatory fallback pipeline in case an essential component fails on the vehicle.  For most cases, `drive` and `recovery` are sufficient.  

Each pipeline defines a *computation graph* consisting of `Component` subclasses (see `GEMstack.onboard.component`), such as state estimators, object detectors, routing, planners, etc. Each component operates in a loop on attributes of the `AllState` object (see `GEMstack.state.allstate`).  Each component defines a *rate* at which its loop should be executed, a set of *state inputs* (part or all of the `AllState`), a set of *state outputs*, and *initialize*, *update*, and *cleanup* callbacks.  The basic idea is that all components in the computation graph will be run in a loop as follows:

```python
state = [SHARED_STATE]
component = MyComponent()
component.initialize()
for every 1/component.rate() seconds, and while still active:
    inputs = [state.X for X in component.state_inputs()]
    outputs = component.update(*inputs)
    for Y,outY in zip(component.state_outputs(),outputs)
        state.Y = outY
component.cleanup()
```

### Creating the computation graph and customizing your component in a launch file

The computation graph defines an execution order of components and a set of allowable inputs and outputs for each component. This structure is defined in the `run.computation_graph` setting and by default uses `GEMstack/knowledge/defaults/computation_graph.yaml`.

In a launch file, you can specify a component by name, i.e.,

```yaml
drive:
  planning:
    motion_planner: MyMotionPlanner
```

which will look for the `MyMotionPlanner` class in the `GEMstack/onboard/planning/motion_planner.py` file.  You can also specify `module.Class`, i.e.,

```yaml
drive:
  planning:
    motion_planner: my_motion_planner.MyMotionPlanner
```

which will look in the `GEMstack/onboard/planning/my_motion_planner.py` file.

You can modify how the component is constructed and run by specifying a dictionary.  The valid values of this dictionary are as follows:

```yaml
drive:
  planning:
    motion_planner: 
      type: my_motion_planner.MyMotionPlanner
      args: #specify a dict, or you can just specify a list of arguments, i.e., [3.0]
        some_argument: 3.0  
      rate: 10.0   #overrides MyMotionPlanner.rate() to run at 10Hz 
      print: True  #whether to include print output (default True)
      debug: True  #whether to save debug output (default True)
      multiprocess: False  #whether to use multiprocessing (default False).  Multiprocessing makes the stack run faster, but logging is not yet mature.
```

### Variants

A launch file can contain a `variants` key that may specify certain changes to the launch stack that may be named via `--variant=X` on the command line.  As an example, see `launch/fixed_route.yaml`.  This specifies two variants, `sim` and `log_ros` which would run a simulation or log ROS topics.  You can specify multiple variants on the command line using the format `--variant=X,Y`.

### Managing and modifying state

When implementing your computation graph, you should think of `AllState` as a strictly typed blackboard architecture in which items can be read from and written to.  If you need to pass data between components, you should add it to the state rather than use alternative techniques, e.g., global variables.  This will allow the logging / replay to save and restore system state.  Over a long development period, it would be best to be disciplined at versioning.

It is generally assumed that components will not maintain significant internal state.  If you implement a component that does update internal state, then the executor will not be able to reproduce prior behavior from logs. This causes headaches with replay tools and A/B testing.

### New pipelines

If you wish to override the executor to add more pipelines, you will need to create a new executor by subclassing from `ExecutorBase`.  This will need to implement the pipeline switching and termination logic as detailed in the `begin`, `update`, `done`, and `end` callbacks.
